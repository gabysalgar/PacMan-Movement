# PacMan Horizontal Movement

## Description
A JavaScript animation that displays PacMan's back-and-forth horizontal motion within the bounds of a web page. This animation utilizes an array of four images that represent the different stages of the PacMan's movement, the mouth-open and mouth-closed in both the right and left directions. The running code  calls a function in 300ms intervals that passes four arguments, the PacMan's position & size, direction of motion, and screen edge size, in order to determine which PacMan image is to be sourced for each function call and in what direction it is moving.

## Installation
First, download all files within the repository and ensure that they are all located within the same directory. Then, open the 'index.html' file in your web browser (Google Chrome is recommended). 

## How to Use
Once the web page is fully loaded, the animation will appear and should depict the PacMan opening and closing its mouth with each movement and moving from left to right between the screen edges of your window.

## Roadmap
I would like to further proceed in developing out the video game application components beyond the movement of the PacMan character by developing a realistic depiction of the classic game background with the proper animations to create the walls and map canvas area as functional bounds for the PacMan to recognize as movement functionalities similar to that of this application, but on a larger and more complex scale of the actual game map.
